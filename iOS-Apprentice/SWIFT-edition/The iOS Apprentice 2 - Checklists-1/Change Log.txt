The iOS Apprentice 2: Checklists

Version 3.2 (8 December 2014)
=============================

- Updated for Xcode 6.1.1.

- UITableViewCell's textLabel and imageView properties are optionals again.
  These properties became implicitly-unwrapped optionals in Xcode 6.1, but as of
  Xcode 6.1.1 they have changed back to true optionals and require unwrapping.
  You now have to write cell.textLabel!.text instead of cell.textLabel.text, and
  cell.imageView!.image instead of cell.imageView.image.


Version 3.1 (17 October 2014)
=============================

- Updated for Xcode 6.1 and iOS 8.1.
  
- The type of the sender parameter in prepareForSegue(sender) is AnyObject? 
  instead of AnyObject!.

- NSData(contentsOfFile) is now a failable initializer, so loadChecklists()
  uses "if let" to check that the new NSData object is not nil.

- Moved the instructions for adding tableView.rowHeight = 44 to viewDidLoad() 
  to earlier in the tutorial. This gets rid of the silly "Detected a case where
  constraints ambiguously suggest a height of zero for a table view cellâ€™s
  content view" warning.

- To set the text on a table view cell you now write cell.textLabel.text instead
  of cell.textLabel!.text -- the textLabel property is no longer an optional.
  Likewise for cell.imageView. However, cell.detailTextLabel still requires 
  unwrapping.


Version 3.0 (1 October 2014)
============================

First release of the Third Edition.
