The iOS Apprentice 4: StoreSearch

Version 3.2 (8 December 2014)
=============================

- Updated for Xcode 6.1.1.

- UITableViewCell's textLabel and detailTextLabel properties are optional again.
  These properties became implicitly-unwrapped optionals in Xcode 6.1, but as of
  Xcode 6.1.1 they have changed back to true optionals and require unwrapping
  with ! or "if let"..


Version 3.1 (17 October 2014)
=============================

- Updated for Xcode 6.1 and iOS 8.1.

- The textLabel property of UITableViewCell is no longer an optional.

- NSURL(string) is a failable initializer, so the resulting optional must be
  unwrapped to get an actual NSURL object.

- String.stringWithContentsOfURL(...) is now String(contentsOfURL: ...)

- NSNumber no longer automatically converts to Double when reading the JSON
  data. You now have to write: searchResult.price = Double(price).

- UIImageView extension: NSData(contentsOfURL) and UIImage(data) are both 
  failable initializers and therefore need "if let" to unwrap them.

- The type of the sender parameter in prepareForSegue(sender) is AnyObject? 
  instead of AnyObject!.

- NSNumberFormatterâ€™s stringFromNumber() now returns an optional.

- Instead of Search.Category.fromRaw(...) you need to use the new constructor
  method Search.Category(rawValue: ...).

- NSBundle's localizedInfoDictionary is an optional so you use optional chaining
  to make sure it's not nil before looking at the CFBundleDisplayName key.

- In LandscapeViewController's viewDidLoad(), the code tried to remove the
  wrong constraints from pageControl (copy-paste error, shame on me).


Version 3.0 (15 October 2014)
